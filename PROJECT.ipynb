        "The reduction of child and maternal mortality is central to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with the global aim to reduce under-5 mortality to below 25 per 1,000 live births by 2030. Alongside child mortality, maternal mortality remains a critical issue, with 295,000 deaths occurring during and after pregnancy, 94% of which are in low-resource settings. Most of these deaths are preventable with timely medical intervention, emphasizing the need for better monitoring and early detection of complications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cardiotocograms (CTGs) serve as a simple, cost-effective method to assess fetal health, providing real-time data about the fetal heart rate (FHR), fetal movements, and uterine contractions. By analyzing these parameters, healthcare professionals can take action to prevent potential risks to both the mother and fetus, reducing the chances of mortality during childbirth.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project leverages machine learning to analyze a dataset of 2,126 CTG records, each classified by expert obstetricians into three categories: Normal, Suspect, and Pathological. By applying machine learning techniques, we aim to develop a model that can automatically classify fetal health based on CTG data, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of prenatal care. The ultimate goal is to assist healthcare professionals in making timely, data-driven decisions, especially in low-resource settings, thereby improving maternal and child health outcomes worldwide."

CTGs, which provide essential insights into fetal heart rate (FHR), fetal movements, and uterine contractions, are a widely used tool to assess fetal well-being during pregnancy. Early detection of complications such as fetal distress or abnormal uterine contractions is crucial in preventing adverse outcomes for both the mother and child, ultimately reducing the risks of maternal and child mortality."

As we move toward the 2030 SDG targets, innovations in technology, such as machine learning-powered CTG analysis, could become pivotal in achieving the goal of reducing preventable maternal and child mortality worldwide. By combining affordable technology with advanced data analysis, we can ensure that timely, life-saving interventions are made possible for millions of mothers and babies around the globe."
